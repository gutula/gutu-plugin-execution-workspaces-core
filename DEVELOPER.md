# Execution Workspaces Core Developer Guide

Governed run and issue workspaces with preview, browser, code, and runtime service lifecycle controls.

**Maturity Tier:** `Hardened`

## Purpose And Architecture Role

Owns realized execution workspaces, runtime service inventory, and the durable state used to operate sandboxed AI execution environments.

### This plugin is the right fit when

- You need **execution workspaces**, **runtime services**, **workspace realization** as a governed domain boundary.
- You want to integrate through declared actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and UI surfaces instead of implicit side effects.
- You need the host application to keep plugin boundaries honest through manifest capabilities, permissions, and verification lanes.

### This plugin is intentionally not

- Not an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink provider abstraction layer.
- Not a substitute for explicit approval, budgeting, and audit governance in the surrounding platform.

### UI Surface Summary

| Surface | Present | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI Surface | Yes | A bounded UI surface export is present. |
| Admin Contributions | Yes | Additional admin workspace contributions are exported. |
| Zone/Canvas Extension | No | No dedicated zone extension export. |

## Hooks, Events, And Orchestration

This plugin should be integrated through **explicit commands/actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and the surrounding Gutu event runtime**. It must **not** be documented as a generic WordPress-style hook system unless such a hook API is explicitly exported.

- No standalone plugin-owned lifecycle event feed is exported today.
- No plugin-owned job catalog is exported today.
- No plugin-owned workflow catalog is exported today.
- Recommended composition pattern: invoke actions, read resources, then let the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime handle downstream automation.

## Storage, Schema, And Migration Notes

- Database compatibility: `postgres`, `sqlite`
- Schema file: `framework/builtin-plugins/execution-workspaces-core/db/schema.ts`
- SQL helper file: `framework/builtin-plugins/execution-workspaces-core/src/postgres.ts`
- Migration lane present: Yes

The plugin does not export a dedicated SQL helper module today. Treat the schema and resources as the durable contract instead of inventing undocumented SQL behavior.

## Failure Modes And Recovery

- Action inputs can fail schema validation or permission evaluation before any durable mutation happens.
- If downstream automation is needed, the host must add it explicitly instead of assuming this plugin emits jobs.
- There is no separate lifecycle-event feed to rely on today; do not build one implicitly from internal details.
- Schema regressions are expected to show up in the migration lane and should block shipment.

## Mermaid Flows

### Primary Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  caller["Host or operator"] --> action["execution.workspaces.realize"]
  action --> validation["Schema + permission guard"]
  validation --> service["Execution Workspaces Core service layer"]
  service --> state["execution.workspaces"]
  state --> ui["Admin contributions"]
```



## Integration Recipes

### 1. Host wiring

```ts
import { manifest, realizeExecutionWorkspaceAction, ExecutionWorkspaceResource, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/execution-workspaces-core";

export const pluginSurface = {
  manifest,
  realizeExecutionWorkspaceAction,
  ExecutionWorkspaceResource,
  
  
  adminContributions,
  uiSurface
};
```

Use this pattern when your host needs to register the plugin’s declared exports without reaching into internal file paths.

### 2. Action-first orchestration

```ts
import { manifest, realizeExecutionWorkspaceAction } from "@plugins/execution-workspaces-core";

console.log("plugin", manifest.id);
console.log("action", realizeExecutionWorkspaceAction.id);
```

- Prefer action IDs as the stable integration boundary.
- Respect the declared permission, idempotency, and audit metadata instead of bypassing the service layer.
- Treat resource IDs as the read-model boundary for downstream consumers.

### 3. Cross-plugin composition

- Compose this plugin through action invocations and resource reads.
- If downstream automation becomes necessary, add it in the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime instead of assuming this plugin already exports a hook surface.

## Current Truth And Recommended Next

### Current truth

- Exports 4 governed actions: `execution.workspaces.realize`, `execution.runtime-services.start`, `execution.runtime-services.restart`, `execution.runtime-services.stop`.
- Owns 2 resource contracts: `execution.workspaces`, `execution.runtime-services`.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Defines a durable data schema contract even though no explicit SQL helper module is exported.

### Current gaps

- No standalone plugin-owned event, job, or workflow catalog is exported yet; compose it through actions, resources, and the surrounding Gutu runtime.
- The repo does not yet export a domain parity catalog with owned entities, reports, settings surfaces, and exception queues.

### Recommended next

- Deepen runtime diagnostics and lifecycle reconciliation as more AI and automation flows depend on long-lived execution environments.
- Add clearer infrastructure handoff guidance where external runtimes or clusters start backing these workspaces.
- Add deeper provider, persistence, or evaluation integrations only where the shipped control-plane contracts already prove stable.
- Expand operator diagnostics and release gating where the current lifecycle already exposes strong evidence paths.
- Promote important downstream reactions into explicit commands, jobs, or workflow steps instead of relying on implicit coupling.

### Later / optional

- More connector breadth, richer evaluation libraries, and domain-specific copilots after the baseline contracts settle.
